/*Because smart contracts deal with large amounts of money and, occasionally,
various types of tokens, itâ€™s essential that all mathematical calculations
are correct. Incorrect decimal handling and fee calculations can result in the
loss of funds or funds being locked indefinitely.

In this example, the 'balance' variable is an unsigned integer that keeps track
of the amount of tokens held by the contract. The 'deposit' function allows
a user to deposit tokens into the contract by adding the deposited amount to the 'balance'
variable. The withdraw function allows a user to 'withdraw' tokens from the contract
by subtracting the withdrawn amount and a fee (calculated as 10% of the withdrawn amount)
from the 'balance' variable.

However, there is an error in the calculation of the fee. Since Solidity performs
integer division by default, the fee will be calculated as the integer part of the
result of the division, discarding any remainder. This could result in an incorrect
fee amount being deducted from the 'balance' variable and the user receiving fewer 
tokens than expected.*/

        require(balance >= amount + fee, "Insufficient balance");
        balance -= (amount + fee);
        // Transfer tokens to the recipient
        // ...
    }
}

/*To avoid this type of error, smart contract developers should use explicit decimal arithmetic or fixed-point arithmetic libraries to perform calculations that involve fractional values. In this case, they could multiply the withdrawal amount by 10 and then divide the result by 100 to calculate the fee as a decimal value, like so:*/

uint256 fee = amount * 10 / 100; // Calculate fee as 10% of the withdrawal amount
