/*Frontrunning attacks take advantage of how blockchain technology
processes transactions. Because transactions are collected into
blocks and added to the ledger as a part of various blocks, bad
actors can buy large sums of tokens in response to large transactions
that will swing the token’s price. By adding a higher fee than the large
transaction they’re targeting, they can guarantee their transaction will
be processed first. After the large transaction swings the token’s price,
the exploiters sell the tokens they purchased.

In this example, the 'price' variable represents the current price of the
tokens being sold by the contract. The 'setPrice' function allows the
contract owner to update the price. The 'buy' function allows a user
to purchase tokens by sending Ether to the contract. The user must
send at least the current 'price' of the tokens in order to complete the purchase.

However, if there is a delay between when the 'price' is updated
and when the 'buy' function is called, a frontrunning attack could
occur. An attacker could see that the 'price' is about to increase
and quickly call the 'buy' function with a higher value than the
current 'price', causing the 'price' to increase before the original
buyer's transaction is processed. This would allow the attacker to
purchase tokens at a lower price than the original buyer.

To avoid this type of error, smart contract developers should consider
implementing measures such as randomizing the transaction order or implementing
a time delay to prevent frontrunning attacks. They could also consider using a
decentralized exchange or a more secure method of price discovery.*/
